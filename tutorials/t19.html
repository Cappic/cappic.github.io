<h1>LENS DIFFRACTION & PHOTOGRAPHY</h1>
<p>Diffraction is an optical effect which limits the total resolution of your photography — no matter how many megapixels your camera may have. It happens because light begins to disperse or "diffract" when passing through a small opening (such as your camera's aperture). This effect is normally negligible, since smaller apertures often improve <a href="sharpness.htm">sharpness</a> by minimizing <a href="lens-quality-mtf-resolution.htm">lens aberrations</a>. However, for sufficiently small apertures, this strategy becomes counterproductive — at which point your camera is said to have become <em>diffraction limited</em>. Knowing this limit can help maximize detail, and avoid an unnecessarily long exposure or high ISO speed.</p>
